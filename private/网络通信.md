AsyncAPI vs OpenAPI

[OAS](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)、[GraphQL](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/)、[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)、[OData](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html)、[RAML](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md)和现在的[AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi)

# FAQ

## AsyncAPI is better than OpenAPI?

[Disclaimer: Following is just my understanding. Welcome to debate]

They are different things. they cannot replace each other

**Traditional OpenAPI (or REST API)**: Implements the [req-resp pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)

**AsyncAPI**: Implements the [pub-sub pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). It cannot model traditional REST API's req-resp pattern (there is [an related open issue in AsyncAPI github](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/94))

## web hook can implement move motor callback?

[Disclaimer: Following is just my understanding. Welcome to debate]

Not sure

**Hook**(callback ) implements a reversed [req-resp pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response). Both Traditional OpenAPI and AsyncAPI cannot support hook. While I find a [REST HOOK](https://resthooks.org/) website

server‘s next action does not depend on the data in webhook's response (except the status)

## k8s framework is better than REST?

[Disclaimer: Following is just my understanding. Welcome to debate]

They are different things. they cannot replace each other

k8s : a container management s/w. 可以理解为软件的安装管理工具，他的管理对象是container

REST API: to implement a service. a service can run in a container or OS
