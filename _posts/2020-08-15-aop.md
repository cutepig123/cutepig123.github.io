# Target

to do some additional task (eg logging) before enter and after exit of specified functions, in a **generic way**



# Analysis

there is a methodology called AOP（Aspect Oriented Programming）

AOP is mature in Java, eg https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:764702da-842f-49fa-b475-5e1e148c03f2/9_AOP.pdf

however not in C++there is no good techniques or tools to do AOP



# Methods

- Pure C++
  - traditional C++: Proxy pattern https://lisha.ufsc.br/teaching/sce/aop_with_c++.pdf
    - This link implements a several Aspect for a Queue class, eg Locking_Aspect , Counting_Aspect
  - C++11 http://vitiy.info/c11-functional-decomposition-easy-way-to-do-aop/
    - this post implements several kinds `Aspect` in C++11, eg for the logging aspect 

- By Tools: AOP s difficult for C++, As the C++ language itself not support AOP. There is some tools by implementing `preprocessing` in C++ source codes, but they are not  actively maintained
