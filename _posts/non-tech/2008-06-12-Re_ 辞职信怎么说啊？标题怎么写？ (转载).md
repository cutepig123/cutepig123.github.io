给你贴一个我的



subject: Resignation Letter



xxx, 



Due to some personal reasons, I have made up my mind to resign my position in xxx.



It’s a hard decision for me, after working within xxx in the past x years since my graduation. I must say it is my pleasure working with you for all the past time, and I am highly grateful for the experience and friendship I have gained. 



I wish xxx will continue success in the future. And no doubt I will strive for a smooth hand-over in the next month.
