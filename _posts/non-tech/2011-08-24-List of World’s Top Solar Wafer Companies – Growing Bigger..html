<p>Solar Wafer Companies are mainly 
concentrated in Asia specifically China and Taiwan.Cheap labour,lower 
land and capital costs as well as presence of major customers has made 
China the No.1 Solar Wafer Producer in the world.Despite most of the 
polysilicon being produced in Europe and USA,China leads the way in 
wafer production.Note semiconductor wafers in contrast are mainly 
produced in the developed countries like Japan,USA and Germany.The&nbsp; 
structural forces of the crystalline silicon industry is forcing 
vertical integration with cell producers making wafers and wafer 
production companies making cells.However there are a few companies 
which predominantly concentrate on supply solar wafers to solar cell 
manufacturers.Here is the list of the main solar wafer producers which 
have shown stunning growth in the last few years.</p>
<p>1) <strong>GCL Poly</strong> &ndash; This Chinese company has become one the <a href="http://greenworldinvestor.com/2011/02/21/worlds-largest-solar-wafer-maker-gcl-poly-set-to-grow-even-bigger/">biggest  producers of polysilicon and wafers</a>
 in 2010 from zero in 2008.Is  expanding rapidly but not getting into 
production of solar cells and  panels.The company is also on its way to 
becoming a Top 3 producer of polysilicon and is expanding by co-locating
 wafer plants near its customer factories.Has singed massive long term 
deals with most of the biggest solar panel producers in the world.</p>
<p>2) <strong>LDK Solar </strong>- This is the biggest producer of  
solar wafers  that are used by crystalline solar panels but is losing 
its No.1  position to GCL Poly.Is expanding  rapidly into other parts of
 the solar  supply chain and could break into  top 10 solar panel 
producer in the  next couple of years.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Renesola</strong>
 &ndash; Very similar to LDK  Solar in  operations and structure,this Chinese 
company is the lowest  cost producer of solar wafer producer in the 
world.It is expanding into  other parts of the supply  chain.</p>
<p>4)<strong> Renewable Energy Corporation (REC)</strong> &ndash; This 
Norwegian Producer was the largest solar wafer producer till a few years
 ago when it lost its leadership to the Chinese.It is now expanding in 
Singapore to reduce its high cost and integrating vertically.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Solarworld </strong>- Solarworld is the Biggest German 
producer of solar panels,the company is one of the few to  still have 
operations in Europe and USA.The company has been battered  by low cost 
competition .</p>
<p>6<strong>) Comtec Solar </strong>- It is a relatively less known 
Chinese producer of solar wafers however it has been expanding rapidly 
and is as big as Renesola in terms of capacity now.</p>
<p>7) <strong>Green Energy Technology</strong> &ndash; This Taiwanese producer
 of solar wafers has left other domestic competitors behind in capacity 
increase.Primarily supplies to the numerous solar cell makers in Taiwan</p>
<p><img src="http://www.greenworldinvestor.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" class="wp-smiley" /> <strong>SAS -</strong>
 Sino American Silicon (SAS) is one of the oldest wafer producers in 
Taiwan and supplies to both semiconductor and solar industries.It has 
been growing steadily rather than expanding too aggressively.</p>
<p>9)<strong> MEMC-</strong> The only big American solar wafer producer 
is building a factory in Malaysia to reduce costs.The company is one of 
the biggest manufacturers of semi wafers.Like GCL Poly,it is also 
expanding into the solar systems business without getting into cell and 
module production</p>
<p>10) <strong>Nexolon</strong> &ndash; The company is based out of South 
Korea and is closely associated with the polysilicon giant OCI 
Chemcials.The company is primarily counting on the growth of South 
Korean companies like LG,Hanwha,Samsung for its growth.</p>
<p>Besides these solar wafer producers other significant producers are 
Trina Solar,Yingli,Suntech,Jinko Solar.These companies use solar wafers 
for their internal cell production.Other companies like JA Solar are 
also expanding wafer capacities in order to reduce their overall costs 
of producing solar panels.</p>
