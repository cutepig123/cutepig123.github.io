<h2>Writing custom visualizers for Visual Studio 2005</h2> <p>The native debugger in Visual&nbsp;Studio has long had an underadvertised feature called <em>autoexp.dat</em>, which is a file in the PackagesDebugger folder that allows you to control several aspects of the debugger. Among the features that you can control in autoexp.dat include: the string that is displayed for types in the variable panes, which functions the debugger will skip when stepping, and string names for COM HRESULTs. The first is the most interesting and useful, but unfortunately it doesn't support complex expressions. If you try to access more than one field in an expression:</p> <p>MyType=size=&lt;m_last - m_first, i&gt;</p> <p>...the debugger simply displays ??? instead. You can get around these limitations by writing an expression evaluator plugin, which can read any process memory, but in the end you're still limited to outputing only a single short string.</p> <p>In Visual Studio 2005, a powerful feature has been added to <em>autoexp.dat</em> in the form of the [Visualizer] section. This section too contains mappings from types to display form, but these have a whole language for evaluating the object -- and unlike the regular [AutoExpand] templates, you can also affect the <em>contents</em> when the object is expanded. This means you can actually view the contents of an STL set, not just see raw red/black tree nodes.</p> <p>Now, the [Visualizer] section is undocumented, and there's a comment at the top of the section that says DO NOT MODIFY. For those of you who are new to Windows programming, that means "edit at will." The problem is then deciphering the visualizer language.</p> <p>P.S. Back up autoexp.dat before proceeding.</p> <p><strong>Basic structure</strong></p> <p>A visualizer's basic structure is as follows:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre><em>typename[</em>|<em>typename...]</em> {<br />    preview (<br />        <em>preview-string-expression</em><br />    )<br />    stringview (<br />        <em>text-visualizer-expression</em><br />    )<br />    children (<br />        <em>expanded-contents-expression</em><br />    )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>All three of these expressions are optional.</p> <p>Like the AutoExpand templates, it is possible to match templates by using <em>type&lt;*&gt;</em> syntax, and also possible to do partial template matches, i.e. <em>Foo&lt;Bar, *&gt;</em>. The template parameters will show up as <em>$T1, $T2, </em>etc. You can also supply multiple types using <em>Foo|Bar</em> syntax.</p> <p><em>autoexp.dat</em> is reloaded every time the debugger starts. It is not necessary to restart Visual Studio to see changes; restarting the debugger, or detaching and reattaching to the target, is sufficient to effect changes.</p> <p><strong>The preview expression</strong></p> <p>The preview expression consists of a single&nbsp;expression to display in the one-line preview of a variable in Watch, QuickWatch, or the Command Window. This can either be a literal string or an expression, which is surrounded in brackets if it contains a formatting specifier. Unlike AutoExpand, however, the expression must dereference the current object using the <em>$c</em> variable. Since a single expression isn't usually useful, you will want to use <em>#(</em> and <em>)</em> to bracket a comma-delimited list of strings and expressions.</p> <p>Example:</p> <blockquote><pre>// code<br />template&lt;class T&gt; struct MyType {<br />    T *start, *end;<br />};<br />// autoexp.dat<br />MyType&lt;*&gt; {<br />    preview (<br />        #(<br />            "ptr=", (void *)$c.start, ", size=", [$c.end-$c.start, i]<br />        )<br />    )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>The parser isn't very robust and you'll often get weird results if you make mistakes. So don't do that. Another downer with regard to expressions here is that the <em>sizeof()</em> keyword doesn't work, which is unfortunate for template visualizers. Finally, colons, parens,&nbsp;and brackets within string and character literals can confuse the parser and give you inexplicable mismatch failures.</p> <p><strong>Displaying children</strong></p> <p>Now, for the real meat of the visualizer: showing children.</p> <p>The <em>children</em> block also expects either a single item or a <em>#()</em> delimited list of items; when present, the object will have a [+] next to it and the expanded view will show the contents produced by this block. Each expression will show up as ascending indices, i.e. [0], [1], [2], etc. You can also name specific elements using <em>name : expr</em> syntax; the rules for the name are a little looser than&nbsp;C identifiers, with brackets in particular being accepted.&nbsp;The order of named fields is irrelevant; the contents are always sorted.</p> <p>Example:</p> <blockquote><pre>MyType&lt;*&gt; {<br />    children (<br />        #(<br />            ptr: (void *)$c.start,<br />            [size]: [$c.end-$c.start, i]<br />        )<br />    )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>The ability of a visualizer to construct hierarchies in the watch window is limited. For the most part, you can only add items immediately below the item being visualized; the only ways available to add expandable objects is either to reference an aggregate or other object with a visualizer, or to use an array expression, i.e. <em>[$c.start, 4x]</em>.</p> <p>Note that the contents of the children block will replace the struct fields that would normally be displayed. It's a good idea to leave yourself an escape hatch by including a field with the value <em>[$c,!]</em>, whose&nbsp;expanded view&nbsp;re-evaluates the current object without any visualizers or AutoExpand expressions.</p> <p><strong>Arrays</strong></p> <p>Being able to plop new fields in is neat, but the above doesn't allow you to view the contents of the data structure, which is hidden between those two pointers. Enter the <em>#array</em> statement:</p> <blockquote><pre>MyType&lt;*&gt; {<br />    children (<br />        #(<br />            [raw members]: [$c,!],<br />            [size]: [$c.end-$c.start, i],<br />            #array (<br />                expr: $c.start[$i],<br />                size: $c.end - $c.start<br />            )<br />        )<br />    )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>Here's what it looks like in the debugger:</p> <p><img src="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/images/debuggervector.png" title="[Custom vector in debugger]" alt="[Custom vector in debugger]" border="0" /></p> <p>The <em>#array</em> statement looks like it evaluates an array. Actually, it doesn't -- all it does is count the <em>$i</em> variable up from 0 to <em>size-1</em>, which you can then use in the <em>expr</em> field. This is actually better, because you can use it to evaluate chunked or triangular arrays. You don't even have to evaluate fields at all; you could generate a table with it if you were sufficiently bored. Any fields generated from <em>#array</em> are unnamed and will appear as ascending indices.</p> <p>It is also possible to customize the value display for the array, by supplying an&nbsp;expression after the <em>#array</em> statement. The <em>$e</em> variable&nbsp;is set to the value produced by <em>expr</em> for that element.&nbsp;For instance, to display the address of each element in the data structure:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre>MyType&lt;*&gt; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children (<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [size]: [$c.end-$c.start, i],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #array (<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expr: $c.start[$i],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size: $c.end - $c.start<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) : &amp;$e<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>The bummer about doing this is that any other fields that you include will bump the indices produced by the array. I haven't found a way around this, yet. If you wrap the value expression in&nbsp;a nested <em>#()</em> it is possible to override the name for each element, although the name will be same for all elements. Also, if you supply multiple items per element, all of them will show up. If they're unnamed they'll get successive indices, so the first element will produce [0] and [1], the second [2] and [3], etc. One use for this is to display a packed&nbsp;array of 4-bit fields.</p> <p>There are two additional options for <em>#array</em>: the&nbsp;<em>base</em> and <em>rank</em>&nbsp;fields. The <em>base</em> field allows you to change the starting array index. It doesn't change <em>$i</em>, but it does offset the array indices shown. (This only works if you don't override the display for <em>$e</em>, in which case single incrementing indices&nbsp;are always used.) The <em>rank</em> field allows you to do regular multi-dimensional arrays; when it is present and evaluates to greater than one, the <em>size</em> and<em>&nbsp;base</em> expressions&nbsp;are evaluated multiple times with <em>$r</em> indicating the zero-based dimension, and <em>expr</em> is then evaluated once for (product of all <em>size</em>) times with <em>$i</em> counting up contiguously. Thus:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre>// code<br />struct MyArray2D {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T *start;<br />    int innerSize;<br />    int outerSize;<br />};</pre><pre>// autoexp.dat<br />MyArray2D {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children (<br />        #array (<br />            expr: $c.start[$i],<br />            rank: 2,<br />            size: ($r==1)*$c.outerSize+($r==0)*$c.innerSize,<br />            base: 1<br />        )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>Sadly, the order of indices is reversed in the names produced, i.e [1,1], [2,1], [3,1], etc. If you don't mind the wonked ordering, you could fix this by doing some division and modulus on the index.</p> <p><strong>Conditionals</strong></p> <p>The <em>#if()</em> statement allows you to conditionally include expressions in your visualizer:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre>MyType {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preview (<br />        #if (($c.end - $c.start) &gt; 0) (<br />            #("size=", $c.end - $c.start)<br />        )&nbsp;#else (<br />            "empty"<br />        )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>There are also <em>#else</em> and <em>#elif()</em> statements to do more complex if statements; these are analogous to the C equivalents.</p> <p>The <em>#switch()</em> statement lets you... well, switch. <em>#case</em> and <em>#default</em> are present, except that there are no fall-throughs and no <em>break</em>. You can do some nice hacks using a <em>#switch</em>:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre>MyType {<br />    children (<br />        #switch($c.start[0].flags &amp; 0xf000)<br />        #case 0x0000 ( #( freed: $c.start[0].value ) )<br />        #case 0x2000 ( #( alloc: $c.start[0].value ) )<br />        #case 0x3000 ( #( active: $c.start[0].value ) )<br />        #default ( #( huh: $c.start[0].value ) )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>Two things to note here. One, the <em>#switch</em> statement doesn't have a scope around its&nbsp;<em>#case</em> statements. Two, it doesn't work within an <em>#array</em>. If you try it, devenv will hang at 100% CPU. For those cases, use <em>#if</em> instead.</p> <p><strong>Lists</strong></p> <p>Arrays are fine, but sometimes you want to use a linked list. Well, the visualizer supports that:</p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;"><pre>// cpp file<br />struct MyNode {<br />    MyNode *prev, *next;<br />    int value;<br />};<br />struct MyList {<br />    MyList *head;<br />};<br />// autoexp.dat<br />MyList {<br />    children (<br />        #list (<br />            head: $c.head,<br />            next: next<br />        )<br />    )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>The visualizer will then proceed to follow the singly-linked list and place each element in the output. Note that the <em>next</em>&nbsp;portion denotes a field name in the child node and not an expression.&nbsp;Like <em>#array</em>, you can use <em>#list() : &lt;expr&gt;</em> syntax to change the way each <em>$e</em> is displayed.</p> <p><em>#list</em> is protected against infinite traversals and will cope gracefully with a circular list. Also, you can use a <em>skip:</em> expression to&nbsp;denote&nbsp;a sentinel node that&nbsp;should not be reported. Although the name implies that the node will be skipped, it actually causes traversal to stop, so if your sentinel node is first you should start traversal after it.</p> <p>You can also supply a <em>size:</em> expression to limit the number of elements displayed.</p> <p><strong>Trees</strong></p> <p>Ah, now for the really evil stuff: trees.</p> <blockquote><pre>struct TreeNode {<br />    TreeNode *left, *right;<br />    int value;<br />};<br />struct TreeTest {<br />    TreeNode *head;<br />    int size;<br />};<br />TreeTest {<br />    children<br />    (<br />        #(<br />            #tree (<br />                head : $c.head,<br />                left : left,<br />                right : right,<br />                size : $c.size<br />            ) : &amp;$e<br />        )<br />    )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>In this case, Visual Studio trawls the tree using in-order traversal: that is, left, then current, then right. As with #list, <em>size:</em> can be an expression limiting the node count, <em>skip:</em> can avoid sentinels, and a value expression is possible.</p> <p>There is a nasty bug with the <em>#list</em> and <em>#tree</em> statements you should be aware of: they do not work if the nodes exist in static storage in a module. The traversal will work OK, but the <em>$e</em> variable will point to an invalid offset instead of the actual item, and you won't be able to see any of the elements. I got burned by this when I tried to write a visualizer to dump the list of critical sections in the process, which turns out to reside in a static block in ntdll.dll, and I don't have a workaround yet.&nbsp;This bug does not affect the <em>#array</em> primitive.</p> <p><strong>The string view expression</strong></p> <p><em>stringview</em> is an odd one: it sets the string that is displayed in the Text, XML, or HTML visualizer. This is what shows up when you click the little magnifying glass on the right side of some entries, like strings. Sadly, this is not terribly useful as all of the text visualizers are modal, but otherwise, it has the same syntax as the regular <em>preview</em> block.</p> <blockquote><pre>StringTest {<br />    stringview ( "&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;FONT color=red&gt;HTML output!!&lt;/FONT&gt;" )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>The usefulness of this is unfortunately damped by two limitations: you can't escape HTML symbols in strings you output, and you can't put literal strings in the value expressions evaluated by, say,&nbsp;<em>#array</em> or <em>#list</em>, as they evaluate to NULL. You can't generate an XML or HTML report from a data structure.&nbsp;It's really only useful if you already have HTML or XML somewhere in memory.</p> <p><strong>Real examples</strong></p> <p>One common container that you might write yourself, and want to view, is a hash table: a&nbsp;nice hash table, consisting of a&nbsp;prime number of buckets, and a linked list at&nbsp;each one.&nbsp;Good luck finding anything in a hash table that has 500 buckets, though, so it's perfect for a visualizer. Unfortunately, if you look at the visualizer for <em>stdext::hash_set</em>, you'll discover that the VC guys cheated -- the Dinkumware STL has a single linked list binding all nodes in the hash_set, and just trawled it with a <em>#list</em>. We have an array of singly linked lists to elements.</p> <p>Can we crawl such a structure? You bet!</p> <blockquote><pre>struct Node {<br />    Node *next;<br />    int value;<br />};<br />struct HashSet {<br />    Node **buckets;<br />    int bucketCount;<br />};<br />// autoexp.dat<br />HashSet {<br />    children (<br />        #(<br />            #array (<br />                expr : ($c.buckets)[$i],<br />                size : $c.bucketCount<br />            ) : #(<br />                #list (<br />                    head : $e,<br />                    next : next<br />                ) : $e.value<br />            )<br />        )<br />    )<br />}</pre></blockquote> <p>Another tricky example: say you have an array&nbsp;of pointers, but want to skip the entries that are NULL. Can we do it? Sure!</p> <blockquote><pre>struct SparseArray {<br />    void **start, **end;<br />};<br />// autoexp.dat<br />SparseArray {<br />    children(<br />        #array (<br />            expr: $c.start[$i],<br />            size: $c.end - $c.start<br />        ) : #if ($e != 0) (<br />            $e<br />        )<br />    )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>And here it is in the debugger:</p> <p><img src="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/images/debuggercrash.png" title="[Visual Studio debugger crash]" alt="[Visual Studio debugger crash]" border="0" /></p> <p>Ehh... hmmm. Well, as it turns out, doing an asymmetric <em>#if</em> within an <em>#array</em> causes the debugger to blow up. It is possible to do this, but only with a big hack:</p> <blockquote><pre>SparseArray {<br />    children(<br />        #(<br />            #array (<br />                expr: &amp;$c.start[$i],<br />                size: $c.end - $c.start<br />            ) : #(<br />                #array (<br />                    expr: &amp;$e,<br />                    size: $e != 0<br />                ) : $e<br />            )<br />        )<br />    )<br />}<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>Hee-haw!</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The new visualizers are much more powerful in their capabilities, and open up a lot of possibilities for interesting debug displays within the Visual Studio Debugger. It sorely needs to be documented, and it can be a bit unstable when you work with it, but in general it makes data structures a lot nicer to work with.</p> <p>(<strong>Update 9/27/2007:</strong> See my <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=172">followup note</a>.)</p> <div> 71 comments | Jul 24,  2006 at 02:08 | default</div> <div style="margin-top: 16px;"> <h3>Comments</h3> <p><strong>Comments posted:</strong></p><hr />I guess it was so long underadvertised, because it was quite unusuable in the MSVC6 days. You added your nice little STL size and content stuff, but the debugger would just lock up or even crash, because for some reason it couldn't handle the macros in a lot of cases. In some cases I even wasted hours on those hangs or crashes, because I thought it was my application having something like an endles recursion/stack overflow or even something worse. And at the end it turned out, I just had to remove all the helpful stuff from the autoexp.dat to get it working again. Pretty helpful...<p><small><strong>Firewave</strong>   - 14 08 06 - 04:50</small></p><hr />I've got a string class that uses non-null-terminated strings. I'd love to see a way to display a range of characters in the debugger -- the normal ",s" watch expression shows the buffer guards past the end of the string. Any idea how to do that?<p><small><strong>Michael</strong>   - 26 09 06 - 21:14</small></p><hr />I'm afraid not. I would suggest the preview block, but there's no way to push out a character by itself. Traditionally STL basic_string implementations maintain a null at the end in order to speed up c_str(), so they don't have this problem.<p><small><strong>Phaeron</strong>   - 26 09 06 - 23:39</small></p><hr />Thankyou for this article, i've been using autoexp.dat for years but it's never been able to evaluate the kind of expressions I need to access the data types used by Alias's Maya SDK. Now I can finally see the contents of those MStrings without nasty debug code!<p><small><strong>Fraser Graham</strong>   - 04 10 06 - 18:22</small></p><hr />That was a really useful article! Do you know if it's possible to display a matrix, ie have a #array nested inside a #array and display the correct number of things. If so, how do you tell it to access element [i][j]? It's almost hinted at in your hack to skip the NULLs but not quite.<p><small><strong>Dave</strong>   - 14 11 06 - 12:51</small></p><hr />The only way I know of to do a multidimensional matrix is to use #array with 'rank'; if you try nesting #array statements then the debugger will just flatten the result. The downside to using rank for this is that it displays the indices in reverse order from normal C conventions. According to one of the guys on the VC++ team, this is a bug. It also means your matrix has to be contiguous.<br /> <br /> If you have a fixed-size matrix, then you should simply be able to use an #array with something like [$e,10] for each element.<p><small><strong>Phaeron</strong>   - 15 11 06 - 23:46</small></p><hr />Great article!! I've been experimenting with autoexp.dat visualizers to display out own types, and have been successful at creating expressions which can display our custom types. However, almost every debug session, I get the crash mentioned in your article and I have to close VS through task manager. The crashes occur in seemingly random places; at the same code location, sometimes it will crash and sometimes it won't. I haven't been able to narrow down which of the 5 or 6 visualizer expressions is the culprit. Do you have any pointers for tracking down / debugging these crashes to determine which visualizer expression is causing the problem?<p><small><strong>Ron</strong>   - 17 01 07 - 14:59</small></p><hr />Nope, afraid not. The best I could suggest is to attach another instance Visual Studio to the bombed one with the Microsoft symbol server hooked up and see if you get lucky with the call stack.<p><small><strong>Phaeron</strong>   - 17 01 07 - 23:16</small></p><hr />Great article! The best on the subject on the net at this moment. Note that I've found 1 behavior (somewhat bug) and 1 bug with visualizers that have forced us to modify our usage of them. First, pointers are previewed/expanded as their pointed type (Type* like Type). We have then decide to start all previews with the object address (casted as void* to avoid recursive evaluation). Second, Type[x] is previewed/expanded exactly like Type. This is a particularly bad when "children" is overridden and the array elements cannot be accessed as before. We have then decide to only override "children" for types that we don't expect in a C array. Visualizers will be more useful once this is fixed (I haven't tried SP1 yet).<p><small><strong>Nicolas Fleury</strong>   - 12 04 07 - 15:41</small></p><hr />I'm having a problem getting STLPORT containers to work. The core of the issue is that the containers point to and iterate with 'node_base' (which contain the link pointers), but the data is in the subclass 'node'. If I try something like:<br /> 	#list<br /> 	(<br /> 		head : $c._M_node._M_data-&gt;_M_next, <br /> 		skip : $c._M_node._M_data, <br /> 		next : _M_next<br /> 	) : (_STL::_List_node*) &amp;$e<br /> It gives me "error | 0" when inspecting the children.  Anybody have success with using the template parameters when casting?<p><small><strong>Ian</strong>   - 17 04 07 - 22:56</small></p><hr />"_STL::_List_node" is actually templatized on $T1 in the previous comment.<p><small><strong>Ian</strong>   - 17 04 07 - 22:58</small></p><hr />The parser can be a bit finicky sometimes, and occasionally wrapping expressions in parens, brackets, or #() can coax it into behaving. In your case, though, the space between the cast and the &amp;$e may be your problem. When using bare expressions in visualizers, it's usually best to avoid all unnecessary spaces.<p><small><strong>Phaeron</strong>   - 18 04 07 - 00:44</small></p><hr />Does anyone have any tips on getting boost::shared_ptr to display nicely in the debugger?<br /> If the px member of the ptr shows: 0x02539f08 {"G:somepathName"}<br /> And I write:<br /> boost::shared_ptr&lt;MyPathType&gt;{<br /> preview($c.px)<br /> }<br /> <br /> I would expect to see the same display for my shared pointer preview that the px member shows, but all I see is the memory address: {0x02539f08}<p><small><strong>Matt</strong>   - 19 04 07 - 17:03</small></p><hr />Awesome.

I&#8217;ve been experimenting with autoexp.dat visualizers to display out own types, and have been successful at creating expressions which can display our custom types. However, almost every debug session, I get the crash mentioned in your article and I have to close VS through task manager. The crashes occur in seemingly random places; at the same code location, sometimes it will crash and sometimes it won&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t been able to narrow down which of the 5 or 6 visualizer expressions is the culprit.

We're using quite a few complex visualizers (which we were able to create thanks to your information), but they occasionally cause VS to crash (usually right when I reach the critical line that will reveal the source of the bug, heh).

Do watch out for the change in SP1 that affects $c vs. $e, which I noted in the followup.

They use one visualizer for sets and maps, but maps don't work as expected. Here is how to fix this without using casts to stlport structs.<br /> <br /> set needs to be declared with two or three template parameters, if you have only one the visualizer won't work.<br /> #tree<br /> (<br />     head : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data._M_parent,<br />     skip : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data,<br />     left : _M_left,<br />     right : _M_right<br /> ) : *($T1*)(&amp;($e) + 1)<br /> <br /> this works in both preview and children expression<br /> <br /> map needs to be declared with three or four template parameters, it' won't work with one or two<br /> <br /> #tree<br /> (<br />     head : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data._M_parent,<br />     skip : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data),<br />     left : _M_left,<br />     right : _M_right<br /> ) : *(stlp_std::pair*)(&amp;($e) + 1)<br /> <br /> this works in children expression but to make it work in preview you need to change stlp_pair visualizer to have only one template parameter and to dereference first and second with $e variable instead of $c. This is how MS implemented their visualizer for pair and they should know how this works ;)<br /> <br /> This was tested with Visual Studio 2008 SP1<p><small><strong>Nikola Smiljanic</strong>   - 10 03 09 - 04:37</small></p><hr />damn html<br /> <br /> #tree<br /> (<br /> head : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data._M_parent,<br /> skip : $c._M_t._M_header._M_data,<br /> left : _M_left,<br /> right : _M_right<br /> ) : *(stlp_std::pair[$T1 const ,$T2]*)(&amp;($e) + 1)<br /> <br /> use angle brackets instead of square ones, spaces are very important: one before and one after const, and no space after comma (it won't work otherwise)<p><small><strong>Nikola Smiljanic</strong>   - 11 03 09 - 10:06</small></p><hr />I have a multidimensional (2D) template array where I want to preview the values of the array.<br /> Does anybody know a solution for that problem?<p><small><strong>zack</strong>   - 03 05 09 - 09:20</small></p><hr />Great article! Helped me a lot!<br /> <br /> Maybe some will find his useful: Just had a little problem with a virtual array build of partial array chunks that are in a tree structure. But I wanted to see all entries with contiguous indices.

The you'll see this previews after the address of the pointer. For this the debugger analyses the most derived class. But if you say<br /> | *($e._a)<br /> you always see the data from the base class, just as if you said <br /> | *(A*)($e._a)<br /> <br /> The same problem is worse in "children". For my smart pointers I'ld like to define something like <br /> | data: *($e._data)<br /> but then I only get the base class part of the object they point to. Pretty useless. So I have to use <br /> | data: $e._data,<br /> | direct: *($T1*)($e._data)<br /> If the object is of the templated base class, the the "direct" entry works and I can access the object directly. But if it's of a derived class then I have to use "data" and open there the node for the derived class.<p><small><strong>Zillatron</strong>   - 03 06 09 - 04:41</small></p><hr />Looking further at the boost libraries you can see an example where User Customer Functions are called out to.<br /> <br /> Basically it allows you to call out from a children-block( ) to a custom user function.

Unfortunately, I still wasn't able to solve my particular problem.<br /> <br /> Maps or sets of "complex" objects (a simple struct will do) or not resolved properly until you provide a visualization rule for that type of object. Which is strange, because such an object on its own is resolved properly by displaying its members. It is also cumbersome, because you would have to provide visualization rules for all those types you put into containers. But what's really bad is that the rules can't handle locally defined types, such as inside a class or function.<br /> <br /> Any ideas about this?<br /> Thanks,<p><small><strong>Hurzler</strong>   - 19 10 09 - 02:19</small></p><hr />@<strong>Hurzler</strong><br /> <em>/But what's really bad is that the rules can't handle locally defined types, such as inside a class or function./</em><br /> <br /> At least classes defined locally inside classes work for me.
