The **PHANTA multiplexers are compatible with every CameraLink configuration** and are capable of connecting any CameraLink to a maximum of **8 frame grabbers**. PHANTA is ideal when **captured images need to be distributed to multiple frame grabbers** synchronously. Applications include **intensive parallel image processing, image monitoring, and real-time image analysis**. All PHANTA models support a maximum pixel clock rate of **85 MHz**, and all image data is transmitted to the relevant frame grabbers synchronously and identically.

Independently control image data path, control signal path, and SerCom path for maximum signal routing flexibility with the ability to independently shut off unused output ports to avoid signal glitch to framegrabbers.
