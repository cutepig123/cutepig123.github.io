<p>1, Difference between Dialog and widget and QMainWindow <br />http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/3465-Difference-between-Dialog-and-widget-and-QMainWindow</p>
<p>A widget is an object that can be displayed on the screen. For example a window or a button.</p>
<p>A dialog is a top-level widget, that is always displayed in separate window (i.e. you can't put it on another widget).</p>
<p>A main window is also a top-level widget, but it has a predefined layout that includes a menu bar, a status bar and place for tool bars and dock areas. </p>

<p>2,明明我的文件都加到.pro里了，为什么编译提示Error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol C++</p>

<p>需要尝试qmake一下先</p>
